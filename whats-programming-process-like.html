      <h2>What's the process of programming like??</h2>

      <p>
        Well, it hadn't occurred to me before, after doing Django for 3 months,
        Ruby on Rails for 3 months, Laravel Vuejs for 3 months, MERN for 8
        months and counting, what i have come to realize is, this is coding,
        have some tools in your repertoire and when you find there's new tool in
        town to accomplish what used to be a difficult task in a much easier
        way, then you go and learn that, and again go on use it, and again, with
        your current tool box too, there are multiple ways you could have used
        it and you find someone else is using it brilliantly and you adopt that
        new method too, and may be there comes a time, when you have to
        absolutely put together a solution yourself, and that will be
        significantly challenging but you get that done too, and I am yet to
        garner new experience but realizing this process itself is a milestone,
        thanks millions.
