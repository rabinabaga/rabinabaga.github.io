       Break the tasks down into manageable chunks, you will get a roadmap to completing the tasks that way
      </h4>

        having "making it easy" sessions

        What you can do instead:
      </h4>
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>take shower</li>
          <li>create but don't wait for likes and views instead get feedback from fellow programmers and improve</li>
          <li>as a creative outlet think of how you can do things differently in programming domain itself</li>
          <li>Break the task down, Have "making it easy" sessions to complete higher level difficulty parts</li>
          <li>work on a project that is close to you and serves you in your <strong>spare time</strong></li>
          <li>grind through the simpler versions first, it will give you confidence in using the tools when working with more complex versions</li>
        </ul>
